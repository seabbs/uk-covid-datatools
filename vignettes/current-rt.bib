                 SARS-CoV-2 infections observed using publicly reported data in
                 the UK, with a view to understanding both if there are clear
                 hot spots in viral spread in the country, or if there are any
                 clear spatial patterns. We estimate that the viral replication
                 number remains slightly above 1 overall but that its trend is
                 to decrease, based on case data up to the 8 April. This
                 suggests the peak of the first wave of COVID-19 patients is
                 imminent. We find that there is significant regional variation
                 in different regions of the UK and that this is changing over
                 time. Within England currently the reproductive ratio is
                 lowest in the Midlands (1.11 95\% CI 1.07; 1.14), and highest
                 in the North East of England (1.38 95\% CI 1.33-1.42). It
                 remains unclear whether the overall reduction in the
                 reproductive number is a result of social distancing measures,
                 due to the long and variable time delays between infection and
                 positive detection of cases. As we move forwards, if we are to
                 prevent further outbreaks, it is critical that we can both
                 reduce the time taken for detection and improve our ability to
                 predict the regional spread of outbreaks",

  abstract = "Accurate estimation of the parameters characterising infectious
              disease transmission is vital for optimising control
              interventions during epidemics. A valuable metric for assessing
              the current threat posed by an outbreak is the time-dependent
              reproduction number, i.e. the expected number of secondary cases
              caused by each infected individual. This quantity can be
              estimated using data on the numbers of observed new cases at
              successive times during an epidemic and the distribution of the
              serial interval (the time between symptomatic cases in a
              transmission chain). Some methods for estimating the reproduction
              number rely on pre-existing estimates of the serial interval
              distribution and assume that the entire outbreak is driven by
              local transmission. Here we show that accurate inference of
              current transmissibility, and the uncertainty associated with
              this estimate, requires: (i) up-to-date observations of the
              serial interval to be included, and; (ii) cases arising from
              local transmission to be distinguished from those imported from
              elsewhere. We demonstrate how pathogen transmissibility can be
              inferred appropriately using datasets from outbreaks of H1N1
              influenza, Ebola virus disease and Middle-East Respiratory
              Syndrome. We present a tool for estimating the reproduction
              number in real-time during infectious disease outbreaks
              accurately, which is available as an R software package (EpiEstim
              2.2). It is also accessible as an interactive, user-friendly
              online interface (EpiEstim App), permitting its use by
              non-specialists. Our tool is easy to apply for assessing the
              transmission potential, and hence informing control, during
              future outbreaks of a wide range of invading pathogens.",

  abstract = "The quantification of transmissibility during epidemics is
              essential to designing and adjusting public health responses.
              Transmissibility can be measured by the reproduction number R,
              the average number of secondary cases caused by an infected
              individual. Several methods have been proposed to estimate R over
              the course of an epidemic; however, they are usually difficult to
              implement for people without a strong background in statistical
              modeling. Here, we present a ready-to-use tool for estimating R
              from incidence time series, which is implemented in popular
              software including Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation,
              Redmond, Washington). This tool produces novel, statistically
              robust analytical estimates of R and incorporates uncertainty in
              the distribution of the serial interval (the time between the
              onset of symptoms in a primary case and the onset of symptoms in
              secondary cases). We applied the method to 5 historical
              outbreaks; the resulting estimates of R are consistent with those
              presented in the literature. This tool should help
              epidemiologists quantify temporal changes in the transmission
              intensity of future epidemics by using surveillance data.",
